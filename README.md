(October 3, 2021: This template is slightly outdated as the WeAreDevs API no longer supports the SendCommand() function. Simply remove all use of such and replace functionality with a script through the SendLuaScript() function. Everything else should still work fine.)

# Exploit-Template-with-WRDAPI
Quickstart for creating a Roblox exploit with the WeAreDevs API

*WeAreDevs_API.dll must always be in the same folder as your built .exe file. 

*You can find the build file in the "build-result" folder. Give the readme.txt file a look!

*When sharing with friends, I would build in x86 release mode.
